You’ve been reading about HTML5’s new features for months. You sit down and set out to write a new website - do you remember all the best practices?

HTML5 boiler plates take care of this initial hurdle for you. Here are two that I’m currently using in some upcoming projects:

*   [HTML5 Boiler Plate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

*   [HTML5 Reset](http://html5reset.org/)

Don’t just extract the code and do minor adjustments. This is a great opportunity to see HTML5 code that has been carefully tended to by groups of web developers for months.
