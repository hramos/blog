I find it much simpler to share quick updates and links on my Tumblr, so I’ve added it as a sub-domain: [http://blog.hectorramos.com](http://blog.hectorramos.com)

I realize it might be a little confusing to have two blogs, but consider this main Journal as more of a source of infrequent articles while the Blog might have more frequent short updates. I’ll see how I can merge these later into a single page.
