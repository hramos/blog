I was looking through my usage stats for the week, and noticed a weird 400% bump in the daily COM:LINK downloads. A quick look through my referrers pointed me to [this article from a Japanese blog](http://ipodtouchlab.com/2009/08/iphone-bluetooth-comlink-443.html), the [iPhone iPod Touch Lab](http://ipodtouchlab.com).

Well, if you prefer to read the article in English, here is [a link from Google with a not-so-accurate translation](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://ipodtouchlab.com/2009/08/iphone-bluetooth-comlink-443.html). The introduction reads (loosely translated back into English):

_Once widely used, the two-way radio is seldom seen on a mobile phone except for business use._

_[COM:LINK](/comlink/) for the iPhone\iPod Touch (2G with Bluetooth) uses the new Bluetooth feature to bring you a free application that relives the nostalgia of walkie-talkie communications._

We now have more Japanese users than all other countries combined.

In the next month an update to [COM:LINK](/comlink/) should be arriving which will bring even more sharing features to the [most popular Bluetooth walkie-talkie application in the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322502765&mt=8) (that side of the world, anyway!).
