Google is launching a new service today, which seems to be a big foray into the social arena, an area where they have been historically lacking.

I don’t know much about what’s coming, but it seems like we will all know within the hour. I can only guess that the name of the new product shall be “Google Buzz” if I go by [Scoble’s tweets](http://twitter.com/hectorramos/status/8863611108) and MG Siegler’s [Tech Crunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/09/google-buzz-event/). They all seem to be dancing around the “buzz” while trying to avoid to break their NDAs.
