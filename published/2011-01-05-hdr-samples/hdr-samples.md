On New Year&#8217;s Day, Addis and I took a road trip to the southwestern corner of the island. We visited the seaside cliffs of Cabo Rojo&#8217;s Los Morrillos lighthouse, where I snapped the following picture with my iPhone 4.

The iPhone 4 has a software HDR function which takes various pictures in quick succession, each with varying exposure levels, and merges them into a single composite which should have a [higher dynamic range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging) of colors (which your monitor probably can&#8217;t display properly, but done right, still looks better than a single exposure picture, but I won&#8217;t go into the details). The iPhone 4 also saves the original, single exposure picture in case you prefer it over the HDR.
