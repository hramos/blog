Today a protest is being held in the capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan. It has become an actively discussed topic in Twitter, under the [hashtag](http://hashtags.org/) #ParoPR.

To aid in the aggregation of the crowdsourced information being spread through Twitter, a small group of citizens have set up a [Posterous blog that so far has successfully covered various sides of the ongoing protests]( http://paropr.posterous.com).

Please visit the Posterous blog at [http://paropr.posterous.com]( http://paropr.posterous.com). It would also be very helpful to tweet about this event using the hashtag #ParoPR, which could help and spread the word about the ongoing events. 

_Disclosure: I created the Posterous blog for ParoPR, however the content is being supplied by a dozen or so contributors from the local Twitter community._
