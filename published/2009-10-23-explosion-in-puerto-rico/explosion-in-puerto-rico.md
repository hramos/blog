A huge explosion was felt across the San Juan Metro Area in Puerto Rico around 12:25AM EST. Myself, I woke up thinking someone had broken into my house. However, I live 10 miles or so away from the apparent epicenter. People closer to the San Juan, Bayamon and Guaynabo area report feeling a whooshing sound or sonic boom, followed by shaking. Windows have broken near the explosion.

Story is still developing. [Search for #ExplosionPR in Twitter](http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ExplosionPR), which for 10 or 15 minutes was the only source of news. At the moment, Red96 is on the scene.
