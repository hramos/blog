Roughly one week after being [submitted](http://www.hectorramos.com/journal/2010/5/3/comlink-11-update-soon.html), the 1.1 update to [COM:LINK](http://www.hectorramos.com/apps/comlink.html) is now [available in the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322502765&mt=8).

Among squashing various bugs that should fix most communication drops, I’ve added a new setting to _lock_ the Talk Button. Access it from the new in-app Menu found at the bottom of your COM:LINK.

There you will also be able to buy an upgrade to COM:LINK+ which can also send pictures to other COM:LINK users. The upgrade is for the lifetime of the COM:LINK app, so expect future updates to add to the COM:LINK+ repertoire.
