Last month I wrote a [guide on using Mint as a BPPR customer](http://www.hectorramos.com/journal/2010/3/3/using-mint-as-a-bppr-customer.html). Some people were able to get it to work, but the success rate was no way near 100%.

A couple of weeks later, [Mint](http://www.mint.com) changed the way they handled BPPR accounts, but only temporarily. Fortunately, Mint has resolved the situation and all BPPR customers should be able to link their online banking accounts.

Miguel Rios, of [Noveltica](http://noveltica.com/), covers the steps that need to be done in order to [link your BPPR accounts](http://noveltica.com/nuevo-conecta-tu-cuenta-del-banco-popular-con-mint-com/). Please note that you will need to search for [Banco Popular de Puerto Rico](http://www.popular.com), as opposed to Popular (PR).
