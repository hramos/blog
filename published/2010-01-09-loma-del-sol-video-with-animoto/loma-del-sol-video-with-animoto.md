Here’s a short video which covers my recent trip to a mountain villa in Puerto Rico.

It was made using [Animoto](http://www.animoto.com), an awesome online service which takes your pictures and videos and creates a professional looking video. It costs $3 per full length video, or $30 for a year of unlimited full length videos. You can try it out for free (limited to 30 second videos); this is a short video about my trip to Mayagüez:

I upgraded to an All Access account, in part due to the great quality of the videos and also thanks to [Chris Korhonen](http://www.twitter.com/ckorhonen) from Animoto, who quickly responded to a small rendering issue I had with the Loma Sol video. Their excellent support helped to finalize my decision to pay for the All Access service.
