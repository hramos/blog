This weekend, the CIAPR and Grupo Guayacán are hosting an advanced workshop aimed for entrepeneurs, any one who is interested in improving their business or founding one. This is a short adaptation of the Entrepreneurship Development Program from the MIT Sloan School of Management, valued at $8,800.00\. This is a great chance to connect and network with local entrepeneurs and investors.

Guayacán is known as the group behind the [EnterpriZe](http://www.enterprizepr.com/Default.aspx?alias=www.enterprizepr.com/grupoguayacan) competition.

High Growth Venture entrepreneurship is considered a key growth driver for many countries’ economies. Today, engineers and scientists look to generate innovative solutions and technology that could result in an entrepreneurial venture, yet the vast bulk of tech based entrepreneurship initiatives fail.  

Understanding the unique challenges and opportunities of tech-based entrepreneurship is essential for converting many of these efforts into real business opportunities.
