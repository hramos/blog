Exciting day! Apple finally unveiled their latest product: [the iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/).

It runs iPhone OS 3.2 *at the moment*, although I’m sure it will see iPhone OS 4.0 at its release due to the amount of changes to support iPhone and iPad applications.

I’ve gone over the new SDK already, like what I’m seeing, and of course I am announcing an update to my bio: I’m now an iPad Developer, as well. :D
