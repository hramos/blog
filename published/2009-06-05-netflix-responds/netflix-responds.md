I received an e-mail from Netflix today. It seems like they want me back as a client!

They are even offering me their *instant watch* feature:

Of course, as soon as I sign up with them again, they&#8217;ll tell me the feature is not available in Puerto Rico. Even though they keep advertising it when they ask me to come back after I cancelled the service for not being able to use Instant Watch.

Hey Netflix, I&#8217;m ok with you if studios really do limit your licensing, even if it seems shady that none would include Puerto Rico (the Instant Watch ban is not title-specific, but service-wide). *But please don&#8217;t try to lure me back with false promises.*
