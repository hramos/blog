The past few weeks have been hectic, so I’ll keep it short.

1\. I’m leaving for [Apple’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference 2010](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) in a short few hours. This is going to be my second year. This time I’m heading out alone, so if you see me around, come and say hi :)

2\. I quit my job. Will be working now fulltime with iPhone and iPad development, amongst other things. More on that later.

3\. The best way to keep up to date with my POV coverage of WWDC is through my [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/hramos) and Twitter accounts. Follow @hectorramos !
