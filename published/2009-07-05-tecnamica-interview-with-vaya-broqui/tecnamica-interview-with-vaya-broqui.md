[Tecnamica](http://www.tecnamica.com/) is a new development in Latin America, covering technology in Spanish. They are distinguishing themselves by creating their own content and producing a weekly podcast covering the hottest news in the tech world. They called us shortly after getting back from WWDC for an interview. It was a very fun afternoon session where we covered everything from the formal WWDC event, to our adventures meeting other developers and the future of [Vaya Broqui](http://www.vayabroqui.com).
